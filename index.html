      <h2>Welcome to WHS Consultations Browser</h2>
      <p>Thousands of people worldwide have shared their ideas to reduce human loss and suffering from crisis. Leading up to the first-ever World Humanitarian Summit convened by the United Nations, many documents were created which contain those ideas. WHS Consultations Browser allows you to browse these data and navigate between these documents.</p>

      <p class="about">This website was created as a submission to the <a href="https://unite.un.org/ideas/content/visualizechange" target="_blank">Visualize Change</a> and its code is open source and hosted on <a href="https://github.com/Domajno/WHSConsultationsBrowser" target="_blank">GitHub</a></p>
      <p class="about">All phrases shown on the left side of the screen were obtained from the <a href="https://unite.un.org/ideas/sites/unite.un.org.ideas/files/public/WHS%20Master%20Data%20Collection-.zip" target="_blank">WHS consultations corpus</a> by extracting top 3000 most frequent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bigram" target="_blank">bigrams</a> and filtering out those with words that are common parts of speech e.g. articles, pronouns and prepositions.</p>
      <p class="about">To interact with the data, click on one word on the left side and then click on another that will appear to the right. You will see several blue rectangles appear on the right side. They represent the documents that contain the phrase you have just selected. The more blue the document the more occurrences of the phrase you will find in it. Click on one to display its content.</p>
